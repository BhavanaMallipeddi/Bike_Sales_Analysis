# Bike_Sales_Analysis project using Excel

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Excel Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset consists of various factors related to customers and their purchasing behavior.This project involved conducting a bike sales analysis by cleaning and organizing data in Microsoft Excel, and creating a dashboard for easy visualization of the insights obtained. The initial dataset was messy and required a lot of cleaning and restructuring, which was done using various Excel functions and tools such as sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting. Once the data was organized, I identified key metrics to track and created a dashboard to display the data visually. The dashboard consisted of graphs, charts, and tables that allowed me to quickly identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in an Excel file named [raw data](https://github.com/BhavanaMallipeddi/Bike_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/raw%20data.xlsx). It includes the following columns:

- ID
- Marital Status
- Gender
- Income
- Children
- Education
- Occupation
- Home Owner
- Cars
- Commute Distance
- Region
- Age
- Age Bracket
- Purchased Bike
